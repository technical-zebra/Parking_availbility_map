# Parking_availbility_map


The goal of the **Parking_availbility_map** project is to provide a convenient and user-friendly bicycle parking map application for **cycling enthusiasts, athletes, and individuals** who use bicycles as a mode of transportation in **Singapore**. The main functionality of this application is to allow users to **search for nearby bicycle parking spaces** and **filter them based on specific criteria**, ensuring a convenient and accessible travel experience.


During the development process, a challenging requirement was to select and maintain a map API that is **cost-effective** and **well-documented** for displaying parking spaces. Initially, we chose **Google Maps**, but we encountered limitations with the documentation and functionality of the **Google Maps React library**. Additionally, the pricing model based on clicks was not conducive to long-term maintenance. Therefore, we decided to use the more comprehensive documentation provided by **Leaflet.js** and the **Leaflet React library**. These libraries offer the advantage of providing high-quality maps and a seamless user experience, while also allowing API users to access them **permanently free of charge**.
